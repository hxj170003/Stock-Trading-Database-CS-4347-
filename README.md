-	API: https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/
-	This platform will not only be able to backtest cryptocurrencies but also a variety of different types of derivatives contracts.
-	This will include stock options and futures contracts. We should be able to find the data needed for the options strategies by using the TDameritrade or Yahoo API.
-	As for the futures contracts, all the information we need should be provided by the CME group. They also have several APIs depending on the exact projects your working on.
